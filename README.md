# Satellite Orbit & Close-Approach Analysis (TLE + SGP4)

A Python project that propagates satellite orbits from Two-Line Element (TLE) data using the SGP4 model, visualises trajectories, and analyses closest approaches in Low Earth Orbit (LEO).

## Features (in progress)
- Load and parse TLE data
- Propagate satellite positions over time (SGP4)
- Plot orbital trajectories and altitude vs time
- Compute closest approach between two satellites
- Flag close approaches using a configurable distance threshold (risk flag)
